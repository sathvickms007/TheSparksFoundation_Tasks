Please click on the images on right side to view my solution.

Predict the percentage of marks of an student based on the number of study hours.
This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w
You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool.
What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?


# Task-2 : Prediction using Unsupervised ML (Level - Beginner)
For the given ‘Iris’ dataset,visualize it graphically.
The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
Data can be found at https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
Use Python or perform this task.



# Task-3 : EDA - Retail



# Task-4 : EDA on Terrorism dataset


# Task-5 :  EDA on Sports
Please click on the images on right side to view my solution (preferably youtube).

As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit.
What all sports problems you can derive by exploring the data?
You can choose any of the tool of your choice (Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel)
Create storyboards. Screen record along with your audio explaining the charts and interpretations.
